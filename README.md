# natural_language_processing-roadmap
This NLP roadmap repository is a collection of resources and tools that can help you learn and improve your NLP skills. It is designed to provide a clear and organized path for beginners to advanced NLP topics, from the basics of language processing to more advanced techniques and applications.

-NLP is a subfield of [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) ,[linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)

-It is concerned with interaction between computer and human language

-Here we program computers to process and analyze large amount of language data

-The goal here is to make a computer capable of understand the contents of document

-In nlp the text is converted to vectors

## History

-Natural language processing (NLP)has its roots in the 1950s. ,Where  [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) published article titled "[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence) “which is now called the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)

-The [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is taken as a criterion of intelligence . This test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.

## Approach used in NLP

**1)Heuristic approach:**

**1.1)rule-based approach:**Example if-else control statement

**1.2)Regular expression** :Every programming language has a support to re expression which helps to find any particular pattern of text in a large collection of text.

**1.3)Wordnet**: It is a lexical dictionary that contains an organized collection of words and their related words.

**2)Machine learning model approach**

**3)Deep learning model approach**

## Challenges in NLP

-Ambiguity

-Contextual text

-slangs

-sarcasm

-Diversity(Num of Languages)

## EVOLUTION OF NLP MODELS

*BOW —> TF-iDF —> Co-occurence matrix —> Word2vec/Glove —> Transformer —>ELMO/BERT/XLNET*

## Various processing steps involved in NLP:

-lower casing

-Tokenization

-Punctuation

-Stopwords removal

-Stemming

-Lemmatization

## Type of nlp

-Rule-Based NLP

-Statistical NLP

##Components of NLP

**1)Natural Language Understanding(NLU)**

-It is used to interpret data to understand the meaning of data

-It solves it by understanding the context, semantic, syntax, intent, and sentiment of the text. For this purpose, various rules, techniques, and models are used. It finds the objective behind that text. There are three linguistic levels to understand language.

- **Syntax:** It understands sentences and phrases. It checks the grammar and syntax of the text.
- **Semantic:** It checks the meaning of the text.
- **Pragmatic:** It understands context to know what the text is trying to achieve.

**1.1)Lexical Ambiguity=**This can occur when a word carries a different sense. This can be resolved you can use part of speech tagging technique.

**1.2)Syntactical Ambiguity=** This occur when we observe that there can be more than one meaning in a sequence of words also know as “grammatical ambiguity”.

**1.3)Referential Ambiguity=** It is often seen in a text that mention’s an entity(something/someone),and then refer to it again possibly in a different sentence with the help of another words.

**2)Natural Language Generation(NLG):**

-it is defined as the process of generating or extracting some meaningful phrases and sentence in the form of Natural language(NL)with the help of some internal representation.

Some of the NLG models are listed below:

- Markov chain
- Recurrent neural network (RNN)
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Transformer

**2.1)Text planning=**It involve the retrieving of the relevant info from the knowledge base.

**2.2)Sentence Planning=**It involves processes such as choosing required words, forming meaningful phrases, setting the tone of the sentence.

**2.3)Text Realization=**It involves the mapping of sentence plane into sentence structure.
